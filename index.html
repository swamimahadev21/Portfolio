                                <h4>Attributed to Vyasa</h4>
                                <p>The Bhagavad Gita, part of the epic Mahabharata, is a timeless dialogue between Lord Krishna and the warrior Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. It addresses the deepest questions of duty, morality, and the purpose of life. Through its 18 chapters, the Gita teaches the principles of karma (selfless action), bhakti (devotion), and jnana (wisdom) as paths to spiritual realization. It emphasizes performing one’s duty without attachment to results, mastering the mind, and rising above fear and doubt. The text offers guidance on living with integrity, inner peace, and resilience even in the face of great challenges. Lord Krishna’s counsel blends philosophy with practical life lessons, urging individuals to embrace discipline, humility, and clarity of purpose. It highlights the eternal nature of the soul, the impermanence of the material world, and the importance of aligning actions with divine will. The Gita’s teachings have inspired leaders, thinkers, and warriors for centuries. It is both a spiritual scripture and a manual for personal excellence. Its message transcends religion, offering universal wisdom for anyone seeking courage, balance, and self-mastery.</p>

                                <h4>Sant Dnyaneshwar</h4>
                                <p>The Dnyaneshwari is a revered Marathi commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, composed in the 13th century by the saint-poet Sant Dnyaneshwar. Written in the owi poetic meter, it transforms the profound Sanskrit verses of the Gita into a form accessible to the common people while preserving their spiritual depth. Sant Dnyaneshwar’s commentary blends philosophical insight, devotional fervor, and poetic beauty, making it both an intellectual and emotional journey. The work explains concepts like karma, devotion, detachment, and the eternal soul with relatable metaphors drawn from nature and village life. It emphasizes selfless service, humility, and seeing divinity in all beings. The Dnyaneshwari inspires readers to live a life of purity, compassion, and truth, while staying steadfast in their duties. It also reflects the bhakti tradition, where love for God transcends rituals and rigid boundaries. Through its verses, Sant Dnyaneshwar teaches that spiritual realization is possible for everyone, regardless of status or learning. The text remains a cornerstone of Marathi literature and spirituality, guiding seekers for over 700 years. It is not merely a translation but a divine conversation infused with the saint’s wisdom, grace, and deep understanding of life’s eternal truths.</p>

                                <p>The Mahabharata, attributed to sage Vyasa, is one of the world’s longest and most profound epics, blending history, philosophy, and timeless moral lessons. At its heart lies the conflict between the Pandavas and the Kauravas, cousins whose rivalry for the throne of Hastinapura escalates into the devastating Kurukshetra war. The epic introduces unforgettable characters — Yudhishthira’s unwavering righteousness, Bhima’s strength, Arjuna’s skill, Draupadi’s dignity, and Krishna’s divine guidance. Rich subplots explore love, honor, betrayal, and the consequences of human ambition. The Bhagavad Gita, embedded within, offers spiritual wisdom on duty, detachment, and self-realization. Through intricate narratives of kings, sages, and warriors, the Mahabharata examines dharma (righteousness) in its most complex forms. It warns against greed and ego while celebrating courage, sacrifice, and truth. Beyond war, it is a mirror to human nature, revealing how choices shape destiny. With its deep symbolism and layered storytelling, the Mahabharata remains not only a cultural treasure but also a guide to ethical living across ages.</p>

Deeply rooted in yogic wisdom, it combines spiritual philosophy with captivating stories that guide seekers toward liberation. The text explores the path of self-discipline, meditation, detachment, and realization of the supreme truth. It teaches mastery over the mind, control of desires, and living in harmony with nature. The Navnath Granth also highlights the importance of guru-bhakti (devotion to the guru) as the key to spiritual awakening. Through allegories and symbolic events, it explains complex yogic concepts like kundalini awakening, pranayama, and the union of the individual soul with the universal consciousness. The nine Naths—such as Matsyendranath, Gorakshanath, and others—are portrayed as embodiments of divine power who traveled across regions, uplifting society and spreading dharma.
